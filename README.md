# MLP_from_scratch
Hi all, I have made this repository to understand better a simple ANN in C++ programme.

Things to know:
- The dataset on a csv file only consists of double numbers (the programme must be modified for non-double numbers).
- The dataset was randomly shuffled and divided into three subsets (training 70%, testing 20%, validation 10%).
- Two different initialisers were implemented: Glorot uniform and Random uniform.
- The Adam optimiser was implemented.
- Only ReLu and Linear activations were implemented.
- MAE, MSE and R2 scores were implemented.
